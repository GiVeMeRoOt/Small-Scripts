Hello...
This is my own program written for the python course conducted by MIT on edx.org.
It was an assignment question and this program satisfied all the test cases.
Instructions to play:
  -Download it to your computer 
  -Copy all three files into a folder
  -Run run.py in your python interpreter after assigning suitable permissions
As easy as that!
